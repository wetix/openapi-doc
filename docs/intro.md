# Introduction

WeTix is a homegrown entertainment ticketing platform, we began our journey since 2018.

## Open APIs

WeTix Open APIs allow developers to utilize WeTix's core functionalities such as get cinemas, movies, showtimes, seat layout and create order. WeTix Open API uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as its data query and manipulation language.

There are two services for our API (OAuth and Open API), both for sandbox and production environment. OAuth server is for the authentication, Open API server is for the core functions.

**Sandbox Environment :**

Open API Server: [https://sb-open.wetix.my/graphql](https://sb-open.wetix.my/graphql)  
OAuth Server: [https://sb-oauth.wetix.my](https://sb-oauth.wetix.my)

<!-- ### Production Environment
